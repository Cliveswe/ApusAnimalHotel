The object with this application is to use three principles of OOP, encapsulation, inheritance as well as dynamic binding and polymorphism. 
Aggregation (or composition) between objects is based on a "has-a" relation, object inheritance helps to reuse code by creating an
”is a” relation between objects of same type. 

You are working at a city zoo where all types of animals are welcome to have a home. This application assists you in managing the registration 
of the animals hosted in the zoo. Animals are categorized according to different criteria, diet Herbivores, carnivorous or Omnivores. 
Or they can have the classifications Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fish, etc. But we keep it simple and group the animals
according to the basic category of gender and species.
Animals are categorized as:
- Bird, examples dove, eagle, pelican
- Insect, as butterfly, bee, ant
- Mammal, as dog, wolf, deer, killer whales
- Fish, for example goldfish, shark
- Reptile, as frog, lizard, snake
Animals gender can be:
- male.
- female.
- or can have unknown gender.
Species: Animals that belong to a categories Mammal, Fish, dog, butterfly, etc.
Each category have common characteristics example mammals, number of teeth or birds flying speed. Each type of species may have specific 
characteristics such as a Dog's breed.
Here we use OOP/AD to determine associations, encapsulation (aggregation) – "has a" and inheritance – "is a" between the classes. we also 
use polymorphism using interface, abstract classes and dynamic binding. Interfaces, we group specif methods of an objects that in turn 
must be implement. Abstract classes are used to delegate some of the work to subclasses. These two
constructs together are key in implementing polymorphism. 
In addition we use Collections and they are widely used to group objects of different types. We also make use of Generics together with 
collections to enhance the application. 
In short this application makes use of:
- Create generic types.
- Use collections with generic objects.
- Serialization to persist data in binary and XML formats.
- Save data to and load from text files.
- Exceptions handling.
- Graphical user interface, GUI, improves with menus.
